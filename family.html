            <h3>Mary & Joseph</h3>
            <p>A son promised to Mary, and Joseph, as an answer to vehement prayers to God...Emmanuel was born....
                How poetic can it be? 
                There were total of three other children, an older brother, and 2 younger sisters.                                                                                  
                His mother was always a strong part of his maturity in Christ. She always ensured
                that her children were aware of the love of Christ that had saved them. Through all of the tribulations, trials,
                and temptations of the world God was always with them. Their family is an example of God's mysterious works and his living testimony
                All of this made him the MAN OF GOD we all know him to be.</p>

            <h1>MARRIAGE</h1>
            <h3>Sonia</h3>
            <p>On May 26th 1947, God gave Mr. Emmanuel, Mrs. Sonia Emmanuel in holy matrimony. 
               Just as God saw that Adam was alone, and made Eve, so is Mrs.Sonia to Mr.Emmanuel. 
               A perfect partner, wife, friend, and a compass to God, Mrs.Sonia Emmanuel kept the family together as she still does.
               Both found their other halves to be an answer to their prayers.

            <h1>PARENTHOOD</h1>
            <h3>The best father a child could ask for</h3>
            <p>Mr. Emmanuel became a father on 24th June 2004... He has always provided the best for his family, 
                especially for his son...
               Through all the challenges and hurdles that come along with a growing kid at home...Like a strong wall of shield 
               he stood up for his family, protecting them from everything. He has always been the spiritual shepherd of the family
               who leads them to Christ. Just as paul says,'Imitate me as I imitate Christ', Mr. Emmanuel shows the reflection of 
               Christ in his daily walk.....A huge inspiration for his son. No amount of words can express the feelings of his parenthood.
