            <h3>Kerala</h3>
            <p>Mr. Emmanuel, due to his line of work spent most of his time, away from his home in Himachal.
               Although he found brothers in a few friends, and their families took him as his own. 
               Kerala became a new home for his life, and still holds a special place in his heart.
               He used to spend most of the time in Wellingdon Island, Kochi, near the Kochi port.
               Attending sunday church still remained a big part of life, in the CSI Immanuel Cathedral.
